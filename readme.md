# Usage

Simply `git clone gh:JonsnowBD/webpack-starter yourappname` to make your app, then `npm install` all dependencies.
You need webpack installed globally to be able to use any webpack based technology. To install webpack globally,
use `npm install -g webpack` and you're set.

To build your app minified, simply run `npm build`

## Technology out of the box

Out of the box you will get:

* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [The Mililgram CSS Framework](https://milligram.github.io/)
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

All ready to go.

## Structure

You'll want to focus development in `app/webpack/webpack.js` and `app/webpack/componants`.

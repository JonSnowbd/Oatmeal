#Usage

Simply `git clone gh:JonsnowBD/webpack-starter yourappname` to make your app, then `npm install` all dependencies.
You need webpack installed globally to be able to use any webpack based technology. To install webpack globally,
use `npm install -g webpack` and you're set.

#Technology out of the box

Bundled with this starter kit is Vue.js, Jquery and my own Espalier less framework.

#Structure

You'll want to focus development in `app/webpack/webpack.js` and `app/webpack/componants`.
